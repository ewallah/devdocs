<ReleaseNoteIntro releaseName={frontMatter.moodleVersion} />

This release specifically addresses a bug in version 4.5.9 which caused site administration access issues on sites using third-party themes that modify the core admin renderer (such as <!-- cspell:disable -->Moove<!-- cspell:enable -->). Sites using the Boost or Classic theme (or other themes which do not modify site administration rendering) were not affected by this bug.

## General fixes and improvements
<!-- cspell:disable -->
- [MDL-87892](https://moodle.atlassian.net/browse/MDL-87892) - Additional parameter for core_admin_renderer function added in MDL-87352 breaks many custom themes
<!-- cspell:enable -->

## Security fixes

No security fixes were included in this release. For details about the most recently fixed security bugs, please see the [4.5.9 release notes](./4.5.9.md#security-fixes).
